# Learning Go

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is the "Learning Go" book in mmark markdown. It is translated
to HTML with [mmark](https://github.com/miekg/mmark).

After some post processing [the end result, can be found here](http://miek.nl/go/learninggo.html).
Note this is a temporary location.

## To Build YourSelf

* Download or `go get` [mmark](https://github.com/miekg/mmark).
* `cd mmark/mmark`
* `go install`

And then just `make` in this repository, and `cd fix; make` to make the `.png` from the `.svg`
with Inkscape.
