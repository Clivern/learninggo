\begin{Exercise}[title={Finger daemon},difficulty=1]
\label{ex:finger}
\Question
Write a finger daemon that works with the finger(1) command. 

From the Debian package description:
\begin{quote}
Fingerd is a simple daemon based on RFC 1196 \cite{RFC1196} that provides an interface to the
``finger'' program at most network sites.  The program is supposed to return a
friendly, human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment or a
particular person in depth.
\end{quote}

Stick to the basics and only support a username argument. If the user has a \file{.plan} file
show the contents of that file. So your program needs to be able to figure out:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the user exist?
\item If the user exists, show the contents of the \file{.plan} file.
\end{itemize}
\end{Exercise}
